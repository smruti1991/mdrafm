The petitioners are challenging an order levying/collecting the Goods and Service Tax (GST) on the one-time lease premium.', 'A perusal of sections 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11 falling in this Chapter leaves us in no manner of doubt that the expression \"supply\" includes all forms of supply of goods or services or both such as sale, transfer, barter, exchange, license, rental, lease or disposal made or agreed to be made for a consideration by a person in the course or furtherance of business. By sub-section (2) and which opens with a non-obstante clause, such activities or transactions undertaken by the Central Government, a State Government or any local authority in which they are engaged as public authorities, as may be notified by the Government on the recommendations of the Council, shall be treated neither as a supply of goods nor a supply of services. Equally, subject to the provisions of sub-sections (1) and (2), the Government may, on the recommendation of the Council, specify,\n by notification, the transactions that are to be treated as a supply of goods and not as a supply of services or a supply of services and notas a supply of goods. Pertinently, no notification are traceable to sub-section (2) of section 7 has been brought to our notice.\n \n On a plain reading of the GST Act, we do not see how we can agree with Mr.Nankani. Mr.Nankani also relies upon Schedule II, which is referable to section 7. These are the activities to be treated as supply of goods or services. The substantive provision section 7 in clearest terms says that the activities specified in Schedule I made or agreed to be made without a consideration and the activities to be treated as supply of goods or supply of services referred to in Schedule II would be included in the expression \"supply\". However, clause (a) of sub-section (1) of section 7 includes all forms of supply of goods or services or both such as sale, transfer, barter, exchange, licence, rental, lease or disposal made or agreed to be made for a consideration by a person in the course or furtherance of business. We referred to the definitions simply to reinforce our conclusion that the CIDCO is a person and in the course or in furtherance of its business, it disposes of lands by leasing them out for a consideration styled as one-time premium. Therefore, if one refers to Schedule II, section 7, then, Item No. 2 styled as land and building and any lease, tenancy, licence to occupy land is a supply of service. Any lease or letting out of a building, including commercial, industrial or residential complex for business, either wholly or partly is a supply of service. It is settled law that such provisions in a taxing statute would have to be read together and harmoniously in order to understand the nature of the levy, the object and purpose of its imposition. No activity of the nature mentioned in the inclusive provision can thus be left out of the net of the tax. Once this law, in terms of the substantive provisions and the Schedule, treats the activity as supply of goods or supply of services, particularly in relation to land and building and includes a lease, then, theconsideration therefore as a premium/one-time premium is a measure on which the tax is levied, assessed and recovered. We cannot then probe into the legislation any further.\n \n We are, therefore, of the clear view that the demand for payment of GST is in accordance with law', 'Pintu', 'Reportable (Builders Association of Navi Mumbai and Ors.

Again\n the test applicable was whether it was a game of chance or game of skill. Only if the result of the game/contest is determined merely by chance or accident, any money put on stake with consciousness of risk and hope to gain, would be \'gambling\' or \'betting\'. There is no merit in the submission that the result of their fantasy game/contest shall be considered as merely by chance or accident notwithstanding involvement of substantial skill. The petitioner claims that the result would depend largely on extraneous factors such as, who amongst the players actually play better in the real game on a particular day, which according to the petitioner would be a matter of chance, howsoever skillful a participant player in the online fantasy game may be. The petitioner has lost sight of the fact thatthe result of the fantasy game contest on the platform of respondent No.3, is not at all dependent on winning or losing of any particular team in the real world game. Thus, no betting or gambling is involved in their fantasy games. Their result is not dependent upon winning or losing of any particular team in real world on any given day. In these circumstances, there is no plausible reason to take a contrary view than that taken by the Hon\'ble Punjab and Haryana High court, which judgment has already been upheld by the Hon\'ble Supreme Court in the SLP filed against the respondent No.3 itself. Moreover, the said issue is also covered by a judgment of 3 Judge Bench of the Hon\'ble Supreme Court, to which detailed reference is made in the order of the Hon\'ble Punjab and Haryana High Court. It is thus clear that the activity of the respondent No.3 do not amount to \'gambling\' or \'betting\' or \'wagering\' even if the definition contained in Finance Act, 1994 is taken into consideration.\"\n \n In the instant case, admittedly, there is no dispute that the amounts pooled in the escrow account is an \'actionable claim\', as the same is to be distributed amongst the winning participating members as per the outcome of a game. But, as held hereinabove since the activities of the respondent No.3 do not amount to lottery, betting and gambling, the said actionable claim would fall under Entry 6 of the Schedule III under Section 7(2) of CGST Act. Therefore, this activity or transaction pertaining to such actionable claim can neither be considered as supply of goods nor supply of services, and is thus clearly exempted from levy of any GST.\n \n \n The scope of definition of \'consideration\' extends only in relation to \"the supply of goods or services or both\". Since, the said activity or transaction relating to the actionable claim qua the amounts of participants pooled in escrow arrangement, for which only acknowledgement is given, is neither supply of goods nor supply of services, the same is clearly out of the purview of the expression \'consideration?.\n \n Since the actionable claim in the Online Fantasy Sport Gaming of the respondent No.3 are amongst such actionable claims as per Schedule III and Section 7(2) of the Act, which are not considered as \'supply of goods\' or \'supply of services\', Rule 31A has no application. Moreover, actionable claim referred to in Rule 31A is limited to only activities or transactions in the form of chance to win in \"lottery\" or \"betting\" or \"gambling\" or \"horse racing in a race club\". Thus, Rule 31A which is restricted only to such four supplies\n of actionable claim, has no application in this case', 'Yamuna', '', 1),

Continuous stay of the officers for so many days was not for search of the premises but to search the assessee to obtain information of the place where the documents could have been secreted by him, was totally unauthorized as it was not backed by any statutory provision. Hence, the concerned officer converted it into a search for a person and investigation, which was not backed by any statutory provision.\n Thus, apart from the illegality of the continuation of the search proceedings, the conduct of the search officers in confining the family members of the assessee to the house and interrogating them again and again was completely blatant abuse of powers.\n In view of the above, the Hon?ble High Court held the search and seizure conducted at the premises of the assessee was illegal and not justified.', 'Nivedita', '[Paresh Nathalal Chauhan Versus State of Gujarat [2020] 113 taxmann.com 462 (Gujarat)]', 1),

This is suggestive of the fact that the proper officer not below the rank of Joint Commissioner had reasons to believe that the writ applicant had indulged in contravention of the provisions of the Act to evade tax. Secondly, it could be said that the proper officer had reasons to believe that the goods were liable to confiscation and such goods were likely to be secreted at a particular place. In such circumstances, the proper officer authorised the Assistant Commissioner of Sales Tax (Enforcement), Division-3, Gandhinagar to carry out the search and seize such goods, documents or books or things. One another aspect of which we take note of is that the confiscation proceedings have been initiated against the writ applicant by issuing notice under section 73 and section 74 of the Act. This is suggestive of the fact that pending the confiscation proceedings, action has been taken under section 67 of the Act with regard to the search, seizure and prohibition.\n \n The statutory requirement of reasonable belief, rooted in the information in possession of Proper Officer under the Act, is to safeguard the citizen from vexatious proceedings. \'Belief\' is a mental operation of accepting a fact as true, so, without any fact, no belief can be formed. It is true that it is not necessary for the Proper Officer under the Act to state reasons for his belief. But if it is challenged that he had no reasons to believe, in that case, he must disclose the materials upon which his belief was formed, as it has been held by the Supreme Court in SheoNath Singh Versus Appellate Asstt.

Firstly, the opinion, which would be a decision, should be reflected in the record. The opinion cannot be a mere ipsi-dixit of the Proper Officer. There must be cogent reasons to withhold giving of copies to the person. A mere statement that it will prejudicially affect the investigation would be only chanting the language of the section.\n \n An offer is made by the Respondents that the Chartered Accountant of the Petitioner can visit the office of the Respondents, and there is no need to give such copies. Section 67(5) of the Act creates a right to receive the copies by a person from whose custody the documents are seized. The said person need not give justification why he needs the copies of the documents seized. Therefore, the argument that the Petitioner must show a cogent reason why the Petitioner needs copies and only an inspection by the Chartered Accountant will suffice has to be rejected.\n \n Tampering of evidence - HELD THAT:- It is not explained how, when the originals are with the respondent-authorities, the said documents will be tampered by the Petitioner. Second, if the soft copies are available with the Petitioner, the argument that if the copies are given, now the Petitioner will alert its associates is also not explained - The Note states that giving of copies would prevent investigation. This is only a reproduction of the language of the section. Further, the Note is prepared on 7 August 2019, i.e. one month after the present writ petition was filed. Therefore, first, no reasons are given in the said note as to how giving of copies will prejudice the investigation and second, the record is created subsequently.\n \n In the light of the provision of section 67(5) of the Act creating right in the person, the denial of copies must be a reasonable action. The legislative intent is clear that the documents or books seized must not be kept in the custody of the officer for more than the period necessary for its examination and copies thereof need to be given to the person from whose custody the said documents or books are seized. The reasonableness of the action depends on the facts of each case. If the right to get copies of the documents and the power of the authorities to refuse the same has to be balanced, then the balance may shift by the passage of time and continuing withholding of copies can become unreasonable assuming it is justified at the inception. The documents were seized in January 2019, and the petition is being heard in the middle of August 2019.

The aforesaid interpretation further finds support from other sub- sections of Section 73, particularly sub-sections (5), (6) and (7) of Section 73. A bare reading of the\naforesaid sub-sections (5), (6) and (7) of Section 73 would reveal that a person chargeable with tax, if before service of notice pays the amount of tax along with interest payable thereon under Section 50 of the Act on the basis of his own ascertainment, then the Assessing Officer, if satisfied that correct tax along with interest has been paid by the said assessee, shall not issue any notice under Section 73(1) of the Act. However, Section 73(7) of the Act provides that if an assessee, who has itself on his own ascertainment, deposited the tax along with interest, but if in the opinion of the Proper Officer, the amount paid on own ascertainment falls short of the amount actually payable, then a notice would be issued by the said Proper Officer under Section 73 (1) of the Act for recovery of the actual amount payable. Thus, from a conjoint reading of the aforesaid provisions, it would be evident that even in a case where an assessee files his return as per his own ascertainment, pays the tax and even pays interest, but if the said amount paid by the assessee is falling short of the amount actually payable, the Proper Officer is required to initiate proceedings under Section 73(1) for recovery of the said amount of tax and interest. The natural corollary of the above interpretation is that if an assessee has allegedly delayed in filing his return, but discharges the liability of only tax on his own ascertainment and does not discharge the liability of interest, the only recourse available to the Proper Officer would be to initiate proceedings under Section 73(1) of the CGST Act for recovery of the amount of \"short paid\" or \"not paid\" interest on the tax amount.\n\nIt is not a true that liability of interest under Section 50 of the CGST Act is automatic, but the said amount of interest is required to be calculated and intimated to an assessee. If an assessee disputes the liability of interest i.e. either disputes its calculation or even the leviability of interest, then the only option left for the Assessing Officer is to initiate proceedings either under Section 73 or 74 of the Act for adjudication of the liability of interest.

The factual narrative in the petition is that, export of goods from India is \"zero rated\" i.e. the Petitioners are exempted from payment of tax on the goods exported from India. The government provides various types of export incentives and refund mechanisms to ensure that exports are made duty and tax free. Prior to the introduction of GST regime in India, Petitioners were governed by Customs Act, 1962 read with Central Excise Duties and Service Tax Drawback Rules, 1995; Central Excise Rules, 2002; and Central Sales Tax Act, 1956 read with Central Sales Tax rules, 1957. Under the pre-GST regime, Petitioners used to issue FORM CT-1 and FORM ARE-1, for procuring excisable goods without payment of excise duty; and H FORM to avail exemption from payment of Sales Tax; Pertinently, a duty drawback scheme was available to them to neutralize the customs duty, central excise duty and service tax charged on any imported materials or excisable materials used as input services in the manufacture of export goods. Post introduction of the GST, Central Excise and Service Tax were replaced by GST, however, customs remained an indirect tax separate and independent from GST and was not subsumed under the GST mechanism. Thus, post introduction of the GST regime, the drawback scheme was meant only to claim exemption of the customs component of the exported goods and simultaneously, Petitioners could claim refund of the IGST paid on export of goods, in lieu of the excise duty and service tax paid on such goods, since these were integrated into a single tax i.e. IGST.\n\nPetitioners exported goods falling under various tariff items mentioned in the drawback schedule, on due payment of IGST. It is claimed that since the drawback schedule prescribed identical tariff rates under Column A as well as Column B , in respect of goods exported and further since there were no guidelines from the GST or Customs department in respect of procedure to be followed in such cases, petitioners inadvertently claimed drawback under Column A, which was mostly between 1.5-4%', 'Though, the challenge in the present petition is also to the vires of the circulars enumerated above, however, Petitioners are primarily concerned with the refund of IGST paid on goods exported by them during the transitional period. The Respondents\' concern is well founded that the Petitioners should not take undue advantage of the drawback scheme. The purpose behind impugned circular is to ensure that the exporters do not claim AIRs of duty drawback and simultaneously avail tax neutralization under GST as this would amount to exporter availing double benefits of neutralization of taxes. However, the fact remains that at no point of time, the petitioners declared that they would forego the claim of IGST refund. During the transitional period, Petitioners have inadvertently claimed benefit under a wrong provision, since there was lack of clarity with respect to the refund of IGST. Should we deny the benefit simply for this mistake when the cardinal rule is that taxes should not exported? The concept of zero-rated exports envisaged under GST is designed to achieve this objective. In the current scenario, exporters pay IGST and apply for refund. Thus, for wrong input given at the time of claiming drawback should not deprive them of this valuable right. We can\'t be immune to the fact that taxpayers have faced difficulties in understanding the complexity of GST procedures. Its implementation has not been smooth and the Government itself has faced huge challenges. The model of matching of invoices for purchase, as originally envisioned could not be implemented and a truncated version of returns had to be introduced. This also entailed frequent issuance of innumerable circulars and notifications in quick succession, extending deadlines, introduction of fresh procedures and such other measures. As a result taxpayers were reeling under confusion which continues until this day implying that much needs to be done despite the efforts and measures taken by the Government. The situation is not a happy one and has adverse impact on the taxpayers. There has been influx of cases relating to such issues. We are also witnessing many cases relating to transitional provisions. Revenue needs to realise the inefficient implementation of the law has had adverse fallout on the taxpayer. Government would have to embrace initiatives that would help the taxpayers in the transformation to the new regime. This would require understanding the difficulties faced by the industry which would be crucial step for success of GST law. Instant case is one such example where Petitioners have been victim of technical glitches on account of confusion during transitional phase. We are thus of the view that taxpayers like the Petitioners should not be denied the substantive benefit of the IGST paid by them on exports.\n\nWe find merit in the submission of Mr.Bansal that the exporters would not voluntarily opt for the claim of drawback under Column A at the cost of foregoing IGST paid on exports, where the duty drawback rates under Column A and B were same, the exporters would have received the same amount of drawback even if they would have mentioned \"B\" in their shipping bills instead of \"A\" for claiming drawback. Since the condition for not claiming IGST refund is not applicable to cases where duty drawback has been claimed under Column B, exporters would have received IGST refund also on mentioning \"B\". Therefore, exporters did not have any benefit in claiming drawback under Column A. It is not pointed out by the Respondents that the Petitioners derived any undue advantage by their aforesaid mistake. On the contrary, it would result in causing loss for the value of the IGST paid on exports. By way of illustration, we take note of one such instance as pointed out by Mr.Bansal that if Steel Strips (HSN7211) are exported then whether duty drawback is claimed under Column A or Column B, the rate is 2%. However, rate of IGST on the said export is 18%. In such a situation under no circumstances it can be assumed that the exporters intentionally decided to claim duty drawback should forego IGST refund. Besides, if the petitioners have claimed and received only the customs duty portion of the drawback and element of IGST (earlier Central Excise Duty and Service Tax) was not included in the drawback rate, granting of IGST refund would not result in double neutralisation of input taxes. Respondents have also, infact, never intended to deny refund of IGST paid on export in cases where only custom component was claimed as drawback.\n\nThe Petitioners have enclosed the cost analysis which captures the denial of IGST refund causing severe financial crunch to the\nexporters business. The impact is significant. To us such an error, that is purely inadvertent and not intentional, should not come in the way of calming refund of IGST. We have also noticed that the respondents have also been alive to the situation and in matters relating to technical glitches, they have constituted IT Redressal Grievance Committees to address the grievances of the taxpayers. Therefore, we do not see any reason as to why the Petitioners should not be extended similar benefit. Since the Respondents have expressed their apprehension about double benefit of neutralisation  of taxes, it would be appropriate that before issuing final directions, Respondents verify the extent of the duty drawback availed by the Petitioners and also whether they have availed duty drawback/CENVAT credit of Central Excise and Service Tax component in respect of the exports made by them.', 'Prabhu', '', 1),

It has been further contended that duty free purchases made from Duty Free Shops at international airports in India are generally paid for in approved currency including foreign currency and this uniqueness brings in valuable foreign currency reserves into the country and there is a significant growth in such sale.\n\nThe petitioner has further stated that prior to implementation of GST legislation, the duty free operations in India were exempted from payment of Customs Duty, Countervailing Duty (CVD), Special Additional Customs Duty (SACD), Excise Duty, VAT / Sales Tax, OCTROI, etc. The petitioner\'s contention is that principle for exemption from payment of VAT / Sales Tax by an Indian Duty Free Shop was evolved pursuant to the judgment delivered by the Hon\'ble Supreme Court in the case of M/s. Hotel Ashoka (Indian Tourism Development Corporation Limited) Versus. Assistant Commissioner of Commercial Taxes and Another (Civil Appeal No.2560/2010, decided on 03/02/2012).', 'Undisputedly, the petitioner is supplying goods to Duty Free Shops and as per Section 2(5) of IGST Act, 2017 export of goods takes place only when goods are taken out to a place outside India. India is defined under Section 2(27) of Customs Act,1962 as ?India includes territorial waters of India?. Similarly under the CGST Act, 2017 under Section 2(56) ?India? means the territory of India including its territorial waters and the air-space above its territory and territorial waters and therefore, the goods can be said to be exported only when they cross territorial waters of India and the goods cannot be called to be exported merely on crossing customs frontier of India.\n\nUndisputedly, in light of the definition as contained under the IGST Act, 2017 a Duty Free Shop situated at the airport cannot be treated as territory out of India. The petitioner is not exporting the goods out of India. He is selling to a supplier, who is within India and the point of sale is also at Indore as the petitioner is receiving price of goods at Indore.\n\nAs per Section 2(5) of the Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017, ?export of goods? with its grammatical variations and cognate expressions, means taking out of India to a place outside India. Further, as per Section 2(56) of Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 ?India? means the territory of India as referred to in Article 1 of the Constitution, its Territorial Waters, Seabed and Sub- oil underlying such waters, Continental Shelf, Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) or any other maritime zone as referred to in the Territorial Waters, Continental Shelf, Exclusive Economic Zone and other Maritime Zones Act, 1976, and the air space above its territory and territorial waters. For the purpose of CGST Act, India extends upto the Exclusive Economic Zone upto 200 nautical miles from baseline. The location of the DFS, whether within customs frontier or beyond, shall be within India as long as it is not beyond EEZ (200 nautical miles). Therefore, DFS cannot be said to be located outside India. Instead, the DFS is located within India. As the supply to a DFS by an Indian supplier is not to \'a place outside India\', therefore, such supplies do not qualify as \'export of goods\' under GST. Consequently, such supplies cannot be made without payment of duty by furnishing a bond/letter of undertaking (LUT) under rule 96-A of the CGST Rules, 2017. Also, he cannot claim refund of unutilized input tax credit (ITC) under Section 54 of the CGST Act, 2017.\n\n\nIn light of the above, the petitioner is liable to pay GST on supply of indigenous goods to DFS. Whether, transaction under taken at a DFS (i.e. sale of goods to outgoing passengers) are to be treated as export of goods or services does not form part of the instant writ petition.\n\nSimilarly the judgment delivered by the Bombay High Court in the case of A-1 Cuisines Pvt. Ltd (Supra) does not deal with the subject involved in the present writ petition. It was a case of a person seeking issuance of writ of mandamus directing the respondents therein to exempt the petitioner from charging applicable taxes under the GST legislations on sale of cosmetic products in respect of retail outlet which he intended to setup at Domestic Security Area at Dr.BabasahebAmbedkar International Airport.
