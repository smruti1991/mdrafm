                    10.06.2020.<br> -->
                    It gives me immense pleasure in sharing that the Madhusudan Das Regional Academy of Financial Management (MDRAFM) 
                    is the apex institute of the State for capacity building of officers in the field of Public Financial Management. 
                    Over the years, MDRAFM has diversified its activities for promoting highest standards of professional competence 
                    in fiscal prudence and financial propriety. The Academy is well placed in terms of imparting quality and need based 
                    training to probationers of Odisha Finance Service (OFS) and Odisha Taxation and Accounts Service (OT&AS). Besides,
                     the Indian Administrative Service (IAS), Indian Economics Service (IES), Odisha Judicial Service(OJS) and Odisha 
                     Administrative Service (OAS) officers also come to MDRAFM for their attachment induction training. In addition to 
                     the above programmes, short term trainings are also offered to officers of different Departments, Universities and 
                     PSUs. Further, seminars and workshops are organised on continuous basis to provide enriching experience to the 
                     trainees. The infrastructure facilities, state of art training facilities and overall ambience of the academy 
                     contributes a lot to add to the beauty of the academy and as well the serene atmosphere inside the campus of 
                     the Academy. Academyâ€™s Library has a collection of over 32,000 books & subscription to over 27 Indian and foreign 
                     printed journals and periodicals. The library also subscribes to e-journals from different database and operates 
                     on Library Management Software. As I find everything is well set here and is in its place. The need of the hour 
                     only necessitates to move on and keep the momentum going on. Besides, we must ensure a disciplined and harmonious 
                     work culture. Our mission is to establish the Academy as a centre of Excellence in Financial Management at national
                      level by promoting high standards of professional competency and practice. Presently, emphasis is being laid to 
                      launch the Mid-career training programme (MTCP) for the Odisha Finance Officers in collaboration with topmost 
                      management institutes of the country with a view to build next level of competency and domain expertise among
                       officers and equip them with tools, skills and knowledge for achieving excellence in handling matters relating 
                       to Treasury Administration, Taxation, Financial Management and in Advisory roles. That apart, emphasis is to be
                        given for the development and adoption of an Integrated Training Management Software to make it fully functional.
                         I wish all success to the Academy.
